## GAME DESIGN VALUES
## 1.Experience: what does the player get to do while playing? How does this make them feel physically & emotionally?

## 2.Theme: What is the game about? How does it present this to players? what concepts, perspectives or experiences might the player encounter during play? How are these derived? Through story? system? modelling? metaphor?

## 3.Point of View: What does the player see, feel or hear? From what cultural reference point? How is the game and the information within it represented? Simple graphics? stylized geometric shapes? Highly detailed models?

## 4.Challenge: What kind of challenges does the game present? Mental challenge? Physical challenge? Challenges perspective, subject or theme?

## 5.Decision making: How and where do players make decisions? How are decisions presented? Is the information space perfect or imperfect?

## 6.Skill Strategy, Chance & Uncertainty: What skills does the game ask of the player? Is the development of strategy important to a fulfilling game experience? Does chance factor into the game? From what sources does uncertainty develop?

## 7.Context: Who is the player? Where are they encountering the game? How did they find out about it? When are they playing it? Why are they playing it?

## 8.Emotion: What emotions might the game create in a player?
