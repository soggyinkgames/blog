description: Elevating in this saturated environment, soggy from the waves, learning with every failure and from the ashes WE RISE
---

Join me on this adventure as I document my path slowly building on the HOW to the WHAT. Learning through every mistake, every failure, every wave, making my way through the saturated and beautiful immense world of 3D game design and development. Taking every stone thrown my way to build the castle, armed with all the right tools including...

* Unity
* Blender
* Photoshop
* Substance 3D Stager
* Substance 3D Painter
* Illustrator
* Animate

People might tell you you're out of your mind, crazy, there's no way you can do it. 
To them I say WATCH ME

The ones that are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones that do. This is for the round pegs in the square holes, you can accomplish anything you want, let your light shine bright and never give up.

So fuck it
LETS BUILD!

Welcome to the blog- Impossible is nothing.
