Join me on this adventure as I document my path building on the HOW to the WHAT. Learning through every mistake, every failure, every wave, making my way through the saturated and beautiful immense world of 3D game design and development. Taking every stone thrown my way to build the castle, armed with all the right tools including...

- Unity
- Blender
- Photoshop
- Adobe Substance 3D Stager
- Adobe Substance 3D Painter
- Illustrator
- Animate

I'll be taking you through some of my lessons learned in building fun stuff, like

- 3D assets
- Game Development
- Programming Unity scripts in C#
- Building real world location terrain on Unity
- Building assets and tools for blender in Python
- Procedural asset creation
- Level Design
- Geometry Node animation and asset creation on blender
- Character creation and animations
- and a whole lot more

People might tell you you're out of your mind, crazy, there's no way you can do it.
To them I say WATCH ME

The ones that are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones that do. For the round pegs in the square holes, you can accomplish anything you want, let your light shine bright and never give up.

LETS BUILD!

Welcome to the blog- Impossible is nothing.
